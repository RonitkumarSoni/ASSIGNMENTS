    <h1>History of Computers and the Internet</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The history of computers began with <b>mechanical devices</b> such as the abacus,
        one of the oldest calculation tools ever invented. Later, the great mathematician 
        <u>Charles Babbage</u> proposed the <strong>Analytical Engine</strong>, which is considered 
        the <em>first concept of a programmable computer</em>. During this period, devices 
        like the <abbr title="Difference Engine">DE</abbr> were introduced, laying the foundation 
        for modern computing. These inventions marked the beginning of a journey from simple 
        calculation tools to advanced electronic machines.

    <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
    <p> the <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> has 
    evolved from vacuum tubes to modern microprocessors.
    The 1st generation used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>, 
    while the 2nd generation relied on <i>transistors</i>.
    By the 4th generation, computers became <em>personal 
    and affordable</em>.</p><hr>

    <h2>Mathematics in Computing</h2>
       <p> A famous equation: E = mc<sup>2</sup>
        Another example: H<sub>2</sub>O represents water.</p><hr>

     
    <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
    The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> was invented by
    Tim Berners-Lee. As he once said:
    <blockquote>
    <p> "The power of the Web is in its universality. 
        Access by everyone regardless of disability is 
        an essential aspect."</p> </blockquote> <hr> 
     
    <h2>Modern Era</h2>
        Today, we use <del>dial-up</del> <ins>broadband</ins> and 
        fiber connections. Computers now fit in our 
        <small>pockets as smartphones</small>.  <hr> 
        
    <h2>Computer Example</h2>
    <p>To display text on a webpage, you can use:</p> 
    <pre>
        <code>
    &lt;pre&gt;
       &lt;code&gt;
            &lt;html&gt;
                &lt;body&gt;
                    &lt;Hello World&gt;
                &lt;/body&gt;
            &lt;/html&gt;
        &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
